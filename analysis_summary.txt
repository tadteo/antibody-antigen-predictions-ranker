SAbDab Database Analysis Summary
===================================

Database Path: /proj/berzelius-2021-29/Database/sabdab/raw

STATISTICS:
-----------
- Total PDB structures in summary.tsv: 9,546
- Total PDB files available in directory: 9,506
- PDB structures in both summary and files: 9,506
- PDB structures MISSING from files: 40
- PDB structures only in files (not in summary): 0

MISSING STRUCTURES (40 total):
------------------------------
The following PDB IDs are referenced in summary.tsv but do not have corresponding .pdb files:

8z8l, 8zbi, 8zbj, 8zca, 8zh7, 8zym, 9b7g, 9bnk, 9bnl, 9c0u, 
9c0x, 9c2h, 9cb5, 9cp5, 9d0a, 9d4z, 9d8y, 9d90, 9d98, 9eci, 
9ego, 9fns, 9fnt, 9fq3, 9ggp, 9gix, 9gu0, 9gu1, 9gu2, 9gu3, 
9hy1, 9hy2, 9hy3, 9hy5, 9ixv, 9nox, 9o38, 9qub, 9quw, 9r2e

OBSERVATIONS:
------------
1. All missing PDB IDs start with '8' or '9', indicating they are very recent structures
2. These are likely newly released structures that haven't been downloaded yet
3. No orphaned files exist (all available files are referenced in summary.tsv)
4. The database appears to be mostly complete with only 0.42% missing structures

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Download the 40 missing PDB files from the Protein Data Bank
2. Update the download script to fetch these recent structures
3. Consider implementing automated checks for missing structures
